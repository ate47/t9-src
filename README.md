# Decompiled BOCW GSC/CSC Scripts
This is a repository containing my best attempt at decompiling the scripts for BOCW\
\
T9 (BOCW) is a pain in that pretty much everything is hashed (more than T8). This means that a lot of the filenames are unknown\
I was able to make educated guesses on a lot of them, though, so we do have *some* file structure
# Important Info
These scripts are a merge of multiple patches from the game's lifetime that I saved. VM 37 and VM38 were where I decided to split the merges, so you will see duplicate entries with different code in each folder. \
\
In order to see all the scripts, please download the entire repository. There are too many files to split into folders.\
\
The last patch included in this dump is from shortly after the last zombies map released. I will dump the latest patch \
when Cold War does not receive an update for more than 30 days.
# Why
This should help t7-modtools developers port weapons to Black Ops 3 for custom maps, and give insight on how certain aspects of BOCW function, including menu scripts, loot items, etc.\
\
This is not going to be useful for easter egg hunters, because -- to my knowledge -- all zombies easter eggs have been discovered by the community already.
