# Decompiled BOCW GSC/CSC Scripts
This is a repository containing my best attempt at decompiling the scripts for BOCW\
\
T9 (BOCW) is a pain in that pretty much everything is hashed (more than t8). This means that a lot of the filenames are unknown\
I was able to make educated guesses on a lot of them, though, so we do have *some* file structure
# Why
This should help t7-modtools developers port weapons over, and give insight on how certain aspects of BOCW function.

# Special Thanks
